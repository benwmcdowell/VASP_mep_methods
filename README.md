# mep_forces_from_VASP
Parses out and plots the evolution of forces and reaction coordinates amongst each intermediate image in a minimum energy pathway (mep) calculation performed with VASP.

Useful for monitoring the evolution of forces relative to convergence criteria during or between job submissions.
